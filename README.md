# LPR_EvaDB
## Car License Plate Recognition Using Yolov8 and EvaDB

### Please follow the instructions to run the program correctly:
  1. add the `yolo_object_detection.py` file to the [functions](https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb/tree/master/evadb/functions) folder in EvaDB.
  2. Change the location to `best_LP.pt` file in  of `yolo_object_detection.py` to run correctly.
  3. Keep the location to your functions folder in your machine to enter while running the program when requested.
  4. Make sure the links to your online videos or images are correct(e.g. not links to videos in preview mode).
  5. Be aware that the recognition of characters in this program is specifically trained for the Persian alphabet.
  6. While running the program, when you see three examples figure of the input frames, close it to enter the recognition phase.
  7. At the end you will see a list of recognized plates.

NOTE: 
  1. the file LPR_EvaDB.py will do License Plate Recognition.
  2. the file LPD_EvaDB.py will do License Plate Detection only.
  3. The file YOLOv8_train.ipynb is used to train YOLOv8.
